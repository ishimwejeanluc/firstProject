1. What is Logging?

Logging is the practice of recording events, errors, and other significant occurrences in a software application. These logs provide valuable insights into the application's behavior, performance, and issues.

2. Why Logging is Important

Logging is crucial because it helps in:

Debugging: Identifying and resolving issues by providing detailed information about application behavior.
Monitoring: Tracking application performance and detecting issues in real-time.
Auditing: Maintaining a record of actions and events for security and compliance.
Performance Analysis: Identifying performance bottlenecks and optimizing the application.

3. Understanding Logging Levels

Logging levels categorize the severity and importance of log messages. Common levels include:

OFF

Description: The highest possible rank and is intended to turn off logging.
Use Case: Used to disable logging entirely.
FATAL

Description: Designates very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort.
Use Case: Used for critical errors that cause premature termination. Expect these to be immediately visible on a status console.
ERROR

Description: Designates error events that might still allow the application to continue running.
Use Case: Used to log error events that are not fatal but indicate significant problems.
WARN

Description: Designates potentially harmful situations.
Use Case: Used to log potentially harmful situations which are not necessarily errors but could lead to problems.
INFO

Description: Designates informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at a coarse-grained level.
Use Case: Used to log general information about the applicationâ€™s progress and state.
DEBUG

Description: Designates fine-grained informational events that are most useful to debug an application.
Use Case: Used to log detailed information useful for debugging. These messages are intended for developers and not generally useful in a production environment.
TRACE

Description: Designates finer-grained informational events than the DEBUG.
Use Case: Used for very detailed logs. This level is the most granular and is typically used to trace the flow and values during the execution of the application.
ALL

Description: The lowest possible rank and is intended to turn on all logging.
Use Case: Used to enable all logging levels, capturing every log message.
